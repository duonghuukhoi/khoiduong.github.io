				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				<p>Since growing up, I’ve always wanted to know how stuff works. Every toy that doesn’t function anymore I will open it up to looks at its components inside from motors to things like logic board. People said:” Curiosity kill the cat” but for me it is something that I’m and will enjoy doing. While doing engineering in Australia, I got my first experience in programming, this is when I really get into IT. In term of IT experience, I have done lite programming in C as well as C++. Not only that, I’ve worked aspects such as microcontroller, embedded system. I’ve had experience with personal computers, I’ve built my own desktop, upgrade my laptop hard drive, repair computer at my old workplace and have two years of experience in phones both hardware and software. One important aspect of IT work are soft skills which I’ve a lot of chances to work on during time in Australia. To be able to understand and met client needs is something I’ve had experience on.</p>
				<p>RMIT University was one of my only few choices available since I was studying entirely in English since grade 10.I was doing IGCSE, IB during high school and spent four years in Australia so Vietnamese University is almost impossible for me. But I’m graceful to be able to join this diversity environment. Also, RMIT is one of the most well-known university not only in Vietnam but also around the world so their qualification is globally recognized. This will help widen up the chance to get a job after graduation.</p>
				<p>Over the next couple of years, I’m expecting to learn more about IT technologies. Not only that, I would like to improve my programming skills as well as learn more programming languages. Hopefully I will get to know more about the industry, work with professionals in a real-life project. In addition, I would like to enhance soft skills such as teamwork, presentation and communications. Hardware is also another important part of IT, I hope that I will be able to learn more about logic board, microcontrollers and electronic components.</p>
